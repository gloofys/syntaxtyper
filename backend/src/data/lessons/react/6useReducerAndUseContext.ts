By combining \`useReducer\` with \`useContext\`, you can manage shared state across your app in a scalable way.

This is a great alternative to external state libraries when your app grows.

**Combining useReducer + useContext**

---

**1. Set up the reducer and context**
\`\`\`tsx
const TaskContext = createContext(null);
const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, []);
\`\`\`

- You create state with \`useReducer\`, then share it with \`createContext\`.

---

**2. Provide the context**
\`\`\`tsx
<TaskContext.Provider value={{ tasks, dispatch }}>
  {children}
</TaskContext.Provider>
\`\`\`

- Now all components below can use the shared state and dispatch actions.

---

**3. Consume context with a custom hook**
\`\`\`tsx
const { tasks, dispatch } = useTasks();
\`\`\`

- This avoids prop drilling and centralizes logic.

---

**Why it works**

- \`useReducer\` holds state and updates it.
- \`useContext\` makes it accessible to any component.
- The pattern is testable, scalable, and decoupled.
